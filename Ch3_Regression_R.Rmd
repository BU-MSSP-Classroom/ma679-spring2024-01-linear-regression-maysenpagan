### Ames Housing data

Please take a look at the Ames Hoursing data.
```{r,echo=show_code}
library(AmesHousing)
?ames_raw
```
The goal of this exercise is to predict the price of the house.

Here is a histogram of the sales price with red line showing the mean.
```{r,echo=show_code,fig.width=7,fig.height=4.5}
ggplot(ames_raw)+geom_histogram(fill="skyblue")+aes(x=SalePrice)+
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(ames_raw$SalePrice),col="red")
summary(ames_raw$SalePrice)
```

Initial linear model without a predictor
```{r,echo=show_code}
lmfit_null<- lm(SalePrice~1,ames_raw)
summary(lmfit_null)
```

How good is this result?  Let's look at RMSE.
```{r,echo=show_code}
sqrt(mean(residuals(lmfit_null)^2))
```

Since the price is right skewed lets log transformation the outcome
```{r,echo=show_code,fig.width=7,fig.height=4.5}
ggplot(ames_raw)+geom_histogram(fill="skyblue")+aes(x=SalePrice)+geom_vline(xintercept = exp(mean(log(ames_raw$SalePrice))),col="red")+scale_x_log10()
```

Fitting the same model on the log transformed outcome
```{r,echo=show_code}
lmfit_null_log<- lm(log(SalePrice)~1,ames_raw)
summary(lmfit_null_log)
```

RMSE is
```{r,echo=show_code}
sqrt(mean((ames_raw$SalePrice-exp(predict(lmfit_null_log)))^2))
```

Notice that the RMSE is actually bigger with log transformed model.
So should we not transform?  What do we get from the transformation?

Here is the prediction uncertainty overlayed on the histogram.

```{r,echo=show_code,fig.width=7,fig.height=4.5}
intpred=predict(lmfit_null,interval="prediction")
ggplot(ames_raw)+geom_histogram(fill="skyblue")+aes(x=SalePrice)+geom_vline(xintercept = mean(ames_raw$SalePrice),col="red")+geom_vline(xintercept = intpred[1,2],col="red",lty=2)+geom_vline(xintercept = intpred[1,3],col="red",lty=2)
```

```{r,echo=show_code,fig.width=7,fig.height=4.5}
intpredlog=predict(lmfit_null_log,interval="prediction")
ggplot(ames_raw)+geom_histogram(fill="skyblue")+aes(x=SalePrice)+geom_vline(xintercept = exp(mean(log(ames_raw$SalePrice))),col="red")+scale_x_log10()+
  geom_vline(xintercept = exp(intpredlog[1,2]),col="red",lty=2)+
  geom_vline(xintercept = exp(intpredlog[1,3]),col="red",lty=2)
```

The log model seem to have a better uncertainty estimate.  What good does that do?

Let’s say the model is for an algorithm that buys the house.  If you pay more than the true price the company buys. If the price is lower, then the company fails to buy.
- If you bought for more than the true value you’ve over paid.
- If you bid less and lost, you lost a profit of the 10% of the house price.

Based on such loss function what is our overall loss if we base our decision on this model?
```{r,echo=show_code}
allres<-residuals(lmfit_null)
abs(sum(allres[allres<0]))+sum(0.1*(coef(lmfit_null)+allres[allres>0]))
```

```{r,echo=show_code}
allreslog<-ames_raw$SalePrice-exp(predict(lmfit_null_log))
abs(sum(allreslog[allreslog<0]))+sum(0.1*(exp(coef(lmfit_null_log))+allreslog[allreslog>0]))
```
As you can see with a better calibrated model you have a better performance for more realistic loss.

### Adding predictor `Gr Liv Area`

We add a predictor `Gr Liv Area`

```{r,fig.width=7,fig.height=4,echo=show_code,fig.width=7,fig.height=5.5}
p=ggplot(ames_raw)+geom_point()+aes(x=`Gr Liv Area`,y=SalePrice)+xlab("Above grade (ground) living area square feet")+ylab("Sale Price")+geom_smooth(method="lm",se=FALSE)
p3 <- ggMarginal(p, margins = 'both', fill="skyblue", size=4,type="histogram")
p3
```
Using `Gr Liv Area` as predictor
```{r,fig.width=9,fig.height=6,echo=show_code}
lmfit_liv_area_0<- lm(SalePrice~`Gr Liv Area`,ames_raw)
lmfit_liv_area_1<- lm(log(SalePrice)~`Gr Liv Area`,ames_raw)
lmfit_liv_area_2<- lm(log(SalePrice)~log(`Gr Liv Area`),ames_raw)
gridExtra::grid.arrange(
ggplot(ames_raw)+geom_point()+aes(x=`Gr Liv Area`,y=SalePrice)+xlab("Above grade (ground) living area square feet")+ylab("Sale Price")+geom_smooth(method="lm",se=FALSE),
ggplot(ames_raw)+geom_point()+aes(x=`Gr Liv Area`,y=SalePrice)+xlab("Above grade (ground) living area square feet")+ylab("Sale Price")+geom_smooth(method="lm",se=FALSE)+scale_y_log10(),
ggplot(ames_raw)+geom_point()+aes(x=`Gr Liv Area`,y=SalePrice)+xlab("Above grade (ground) living area square feet")+ylab("Sale Price")+geom_smooth(method="lm",se=FALSE)+scale_y_log10()+scale_x_log10(),
qplot(predict(lmfit_liv_area_0),residuals(lmfit_liv_area_0))+geom_smooth(method="rlm")+geom_hline(yintercept = 0,lty=2),
qplot(predict(lmfit_liv_area_1),residuals(lmfit_liv_area_1))+geom_smooth(method="rlm")+geom_hline(yintercept = 0,lty=2),
qplot(predict(lmfit_liv_area_2),residuals(lmfit_liv_area_2))+geom_smooth(method="rlm")+geom_hline(yintercept = 0,lty=2),
ncol=3
)
```

Because of the skewness it's better to take log on both x and y.
```{r,fig.width=7,fig.height=4,echo=show_code,fig.width=7,fig.height=5.5}
p=ggplot(ames_raw)+geom_point()+aes(x=`Gr Liv Area`,y=SalePrice)+xlab("Above grade (ground) living area square feet")+ylab("Sale Price")+geom_smooth(method="lm",se=FALSE)+scale_y_log10()+scale_x_log10()
p3 <- ggMarginal(p, margins = 'both', fill="skyblue", size=4,type="histogram")
p3
```

```{r,fig.width=6,fig.height=4,echo=show_code}
lm_mod_1 <- lm(log(SalePrice)~log(`Gr Liv Area`),ames_raw)
summary(lm_mod_1)
```

However, the residual still shows heterogeneous spread.
```{r,echo=show_code,fig.width=7,fig.height=4.5}
plot(predict(lm_mod_1),resid(lm_mod_1),main="residual plot");abline(h=0,lty=2,col="grey")
library(quantreg)
qu<-rq(resid(lm_mod_1)~predict(lm_mod_1),tau = c(0.1, 0.9))

colors <- c("#ffe6e6", "#ffcccc", "#ff9999", "#ff6666", "#ff3333",
            "#ff0000", "#cc0000", "#b30000", "#800000", "#4d0000", "#000000")
for (j in 1:ncol(qu$coefficients)) {
    abline(coef(qu)[, j], col = colors[j])
}
```

Did we reduce the residual variability?
```{r,fig.width=7,fig.height=4,echo=show_code,fig.width=7,fig.height=4.5}
logSalePrice<-log(ames_raw$SalePrice)
clogSalePricec <-logSalePrice-mean(logSalePrice)
rlogSalePricec<-resid(lm_mod_1)
labs<-c("mean","regression")
names(labs)<-c("clogSalePricec","rlogSalePricec")
ggplot(melt(data.frame(clogSalePricec,rlogSalePricec)))+
  geom_histogram(fill="skyblue")+
  aes(x=value,color=variable)+geom_vline(xintercept = 0,col="red")+
  facet_grid(variable~.,labeller = labeller(variable = labs))
anova(lm_mod_1)
```

Looking at correlation with predictors.

```{r,fig.width=9,fig.height=7,echo=show_code}
#`Lot Area`,`Year Built`,`Year Remod/Add`,`Total Bsmt SF`,`1st Flr SF`,`2nd Flr SF`,`Low Qual Fin SF`,`Gr Liv Area`,`Full Bath`,`Half Bath`,`Bsmt Full Bath`,`Bsmt Half Bath`,`TotRmsAbvGrd`,`Garage Area`,`Wood Deck SF`,`Open Porch SF`,`Pool Area`,`Sale Type`
M <-cor(ames_raw[,c("Lot Area","Year Built","Year Remod/Add","Total Bsmt SF","1st Flr SF","2nd Flr SF","Low Qual Fin SF","Gr Liv Area","Full Bath","Half Bath","Bsmt Full Bath","Bsmt Half Bath","TotRms AbvGrd","Garage Area","Wood Deck SF","Open Porch SF","Pool Area","SalePrice")],use="pairwise.complete.obs")
corrplot(M, type="upper", order="hclust",
         col=brewer.pal(n=8, name="RdYlBu"))

```

```{r,fig.width=9,fig.height=7,echo=show_code}
mames<-melt(ames_raw[,c("Lot Area","Year Built","Year Remod/Add","Total Bsmt SF","1st Flr SF","2nd Flr SF","Low Qual Fin SF","Gr Liv Area","Full Bath","Half Bath","Bsmt Full Bath","Bsmt Half Bath","TotRms AbvGrd","Garage Area","Wood Deck SF","Open Porch SF","Pool Area","SalePrice")],id.vars = "SalePrice")
ggplot(mames)+geom_point()+aes(x=value,y=SalePrice)+facet_wrap(variable~.,scales = "free")
```

### thinking about the `Lot Area`

When looking at lot area, its no surprise to have some relationship with the price.
But the relationship is not clear linear one.  Why?
```{r,fig.width=6,fig.height=4,echo=show_code}
ggplot(ames_raw)+geom_point()+aes(x=`Lot Area`,y=SalePrice)+xlab("Lot size in square feet")+ylab("Sale Price")+geom_smooth(method="lm",se=FALSE)+scale_y_log10()+scale_x_log10()#+facet_grid(~`Bedroom AbvGr`)
```

If you look at this by the neighborhood it become obvious how in some places size matters more than others.
```{r,fig.width=9,fig.height=7,echo=show_code}
ggplot(ames_raw)+geom_point(alpha=0.3)+aes(x=`Lot Area`,y=SalePrice,color=factor(Neighborhood))+xlab("Above grade (ground) living area square feet")+ylab("Sale Price")+geom_smooth(method="lm",se=FALSE)+scale_y_log10()+scale_x_log10()+ theme(legend.position = "none")+facet_wrap(~Neighborhood)

```

### Prediction of future price based on data upto 2008

To make the project more realistic, I will split the data into before 2008 and after.
The data up to 2008 will be the training data nd after will be the testing data.

```{r,echo=show_code}
ames_raw_2008=ames_raw[ames_raw$`Yr Sold`<2008,]
ames_raw_2009=ames_raw[ames_raw$`Yr Sold`>=2008,]
```

If you look at the time trend, it seems the price is fairly stable over the years.

```{r,warning=FALSE,echo=show_code}
ames_raw$saledt <- ym(paste0(ames_raw$`Yr Sold`,"-",ames_raw$`Mo Sold`))

rolling_median <- function(formula, data, n_roll = 11, ...) {
  x <- data$x[order(data$x)]
  y <- data$y[order(data$x)]
  y <- zoo::rollmedian(y, n_roll, na.pad = TRUE)
  structure(list(x = x, y = y, f = approxfun(x, y)), class = "rollmed")
}

predict.rollmed <- function(mod, newdata, ...) {
  setNames(mod$f(newdata$x), newdata$x)
}
p=ggplot(ames_raw)+geom_point()+aes(x=saledt,y=SalePrice)+xlab("Sale Date")+ylab("Sale Price")+scale_y_log10()+geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = "rolling_median",se=FALSE)+geom_vline(xintercept=ym("2008-01"),lty=2,col="orange")
p3 <- ggMarginal(p, margins = 'y', fill="skyblue", size=4,type="histogram")
p3
```


Fitting the null model on the training data
```{r,echo=show_code}
lmfit_null_2008     <- lm(SalePrice~1,ames_raw_2008)
lmfit_null_log_2008 <- lm(log(SalePrice)~1,ames_raw_2008)
```

Comparing the MSE
```{r,echo=show_code}
sqrt(mean((ames_raw_2009$SalePrice-predict(lmfit_null,newdata=ames_raw_2009))^2))
sqrt(mean((ames_raw_2009$SalePrice-exp(predict(lmfit_null_log,newdata=ames_raw_2009)))^2))
```

Comparing the business loss
```{r,echo=show_code}
allres_2009=ames_raw_2009$SalePrice-predict(lmfit_null,newdata=ames_raw_2009)
abs(sum(allres_2009[allres_2009<0]))+sum(0.1*(coef(lmfit_null_2008)+allres_2009[allres_2009>0]))

allreslog_2009<-(ames_raw_2009$SalePrice-exp(predict(lmfit_null_log,newdata=ames_raw_2009)))
abs(sum(allreslog_2009[allreslog_2009<0]))+sum(0.1*(exp(coef(lmfit_null_log_2008))+allreslog_2009[allreslog_2009>0]))
```

### In class activity

Use data of `ames_raw` up to 2008 predict the housing price for the later years.
```{r,echo=show_code}
ames_raw_2008=ames_raw[ames_raw$`Yr Sold`<2008,]
ames_raw_2009=ames_raw[ames_raw$`Yr Sold`>=2008,]
```

Use the following loss function calculator.
```{r,echo=show_code}
calc_loss<-function(prediction,actual){
  difpred <- actual-prediction
  RMSE <-sqrt(mean(difpred^2))
  operation_loss<-abs(sum(difpred[difpred<0]))+sum(0.1*actual[difpred>0])
  return(
    list(RMSE,operation_loss
         )
  )
}
```

Here are few rules:
- You are not allowed to use the test data.
- You cannot use automatic variable selection.
- You need to explain why you added each variable.

```{r,eval=FALSE,echo=show_code}
lmfit_2008<- # ["your model here"] # use ames_raw_2008
```

When you decide on your model use the following to come up with your test loss.
```{r,eval=FALSE,echo=show_code}
pred_2009<-exp(predict(lmfit_2008,newdata=ames_raw_2009))
calc_loss(pred_2009,ames_raw_2009$SalePrice)
```

## Additional Material

### K-nn regression

You can do KNN regression using FNN package.
Read more about it here:
https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/r4sl/knn-reg.html

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(FNN)
knn.reg(train = ?, test = ?, y = ?, k = ?)
```

- train: the predictors of the training data
- test: the predictor values,  x, at which we would like to make predictions
- y: the response for the training data
- k: the number of neighbors to consider


### [Advanced] Predictive Modeling Platforms in R

There are few platforms in R that does predictive modeling.
These platforms are wrappers around other packages that makes it easy to do routine tasks.

- mlr3 (https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com)
- tidymodels (https://www.tidymodels.org/)
- caret (https://topepo.github.io/caret/)
- h2o (https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-r/docs/index.html)

```{r,echo=show_code}
# split the data
index <- sample(1:nrow(ames_raw), 0.7*nrow(ames_raw))
vars <- c("SalePrice","Lot Area","Gr Liv Area","Full Bath")
train <- ames_raw[ index, vars]
test  <- ames_raw[-index, vars]
colnames(train) <- make.names(colnames(train))
colnames(test)  <- make.names(colnames(test))

# mlr3 TaskRegr
train$SalePrice <- log(train$SalePrice)
```


#### Prediction using mlr3

MLR3 is a useful ML platform on R.
You can learn about it here:
https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com
There is MLR and MLR3.  It's better to use 3 since MLR is no longer actively developed.

```{r,echo=show_code}
# load packages and data
library(mlr3)
library(mlr3learners)

# fit a model

task <- as_task_regr(train, target ="SalePrice",id = "ames_raw")

# TaskRegr$new(id = "ames_raw", backend = train, target ="SalePrice")
learner <- lrn("regr.lm", predict_type = "response")
learner$train(task)
prediction=predict(learner,newdata=test)
```

#### Prediction using [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/)

Tidymodels is another one of the tidy family that is similar to mlr3.
https://www.tidymodels.org/

```{r,echo=show_code}
# load packages and data
library(tidymodels)
library(dotwhisker)
# fit a model
rec <- recipe(SalePrice ~ ., data = train) 

clf <- linear_reg() 

wflow <- workflow() %>%
         add_recipe(rec) %>%
         add_model(clf)

lm_fit <- wflow %>% fit(data = train)
prediction=predict(lm_fit,new_data=test)
tidy(lm_fit) %>% 
  dwplot(dot_args = list(size = 2, color = "black"),
         whisker_args = list(color = "black"),
         vline = geom_vline(xintercept = 0, colour = "grey50", linetype = 2))

```

#### Prediction using caret

```{r,echo=show_code}
# load packages and data
library(caret)

# fit a model
ctrl <- trainControl(method = "none")
lm_model <- train(SalePrice ~ ., data = train, method = "lm", trControl = ctrl)

prediction=predict(lm_model,newdata = test)

```

#### Prediction using h2o

H2O is a cross platform library that is popular in the predictive modeling space.  They work well out of box and can be called from any platform independent of the language used.  Making it work on R could sometimes be a headache.  So try using H2O but if you cannot make it work, I recommend you leave this section alone.


If you are on Mac you will need to install Java (http://www.java.com ).

```{r,echo=show_code,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("h2o")
# load packages and data
library(h2o)
packageVersion("h2o")
```


##### Starting H2O

To use H2O you need to instantiate it.

```{r,echo=show_code,eval=FALSE}
# nthreads specifies number of threads. -1 means use all the CPU cores.
# max_mem_size specifies the maximum amount of RAM to use.
localH2O <- h2o.init(nthreads = -1, max_mem_size="4g")
```

You can access H2O instance using the web UI FLOW by typing 
 http://localhost:54321
 in your browser.

##### Serving the data to H2O

Since H2O is not in R, you need to tell it to use your data.

```{r,echo=show_code,eval=FALSE}
train_hf <- as.h2o(train)
test_hf <- as.h2o(test)
```

##### Fitting GLM

### Best Linear Unbiased Estimator

#### Euler and motion of planets

The idea of regression started with Euler(1949) when he was studying the motion of planets.  He wanted to predict the location of Jupiter.  Euler had 75 observations for a linear model with seven unknown constants; equivalently, he had 75 equations and seven unknowns.

Let's translate this into a more familiar notation that we are used to.  We will let 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_i=\varphi_i\verb|, |\boldsymbol{\beta}=\left(\begin{array}{c}
\beta_1\\
\beta_2\\
\vdots\\
\beta_p
\end{array}\right)
 \verb|, and | \mathbf{X}_i=\left(\begin{array}{c}
x_{i1} \\
x_{i2} \\
\vdots\\
x_{ip} \\
\end{array}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

Then, we can write the equation as
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_i=\mathbf{X}_i^T\boldsymbol{\beta}=x_{i1}\beta_1+x_{i2}\beta_2+\cdots+x_{ip}\beta_p \verb| for |i=1,\cdots,n=75
\end{eqnarray*}

There are a few assumptions that went into the model

- $y_i$ is linear in $\beta$
- But it can be non-linear in the variables.
- The model is known to be correct a priori

From calculus, we know that when we have seven unknowns, we need seven equations to estimate those unknowns.  Since Euler had 75 equations, he needed a way to convert those 75 equations into seven equations.  The simplest thing to do is randomly choose seven equations out of 75 equations and solve for the unknowns using only the selected equations.  But Laplace came up with a better idea: to combine 75 equations so that you get seven equations as weighted linear combinations of the 75 equations.  That is, each equation is

\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum^n_{i=1}w_iy_i=\sum^n_{i=1}w_i\mathbf{X}_i^T\boldsymbol{\beta}
\end{eqnarray*}

If we combine all the weights into a matrix
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathbf{W}=\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
w_{11}&w_{12}&\cdots &w_{1p} \\
\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\
w_{n1}&w_{n2}&\cdots &w_{np} \\
\end{array}
\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

Then 75 equations $Y_{75\times 1}=\mathbf{X}_{75\times 7}\boldsymbol{\beta}_{7\times1}$ can be expressed as 
\begin{eqnarray*}
(\mathbf{W}^TY)_{7\times 1}=(\mathbf{W}^T\mathbf{X})_{7\times 7}\boldsymbol{\beta} \rightarrow (\mathbf{W}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}(\mathbf{W}^TY)_{7\times 1}=\hat{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}
\end{eqnarray*}

This makes us ask a new question: what $\mathbf{W}$ do we want to get the optimal estimate of $\boldsymbol{\beta}$?

#### Special case for when $p=1$
Let us start with a case where we only have one unknown variable.  we have 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathbf{X}=\left[
\begin{array}{c}
x_{1} \\
\vdots\\
x_{n} \\
\end{array}
\right]\verb|, |
Y=\left[
\begin{array}{c}
y_{1} \\
\vdots\\
y_{n} \\
\end{array}
\right]\verb|, and |
\mathbf{W}=\left[
\begin{array}{c}
w_{1} \\
\vdots\\
w_{n} \\
\end{array}
\right]
\end{eqnarray*} 

In this case, we can combine $n$ equations as 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum^n_{i=1}w_iy_i=\sum^n_{i=1}w_i\mathbf{X}_i^T\boldsymbol{\beta}
\end{eqnarray*}
solving for $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ gives us
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}&=&\frac{\sum_i^n w_iy_i}{\sum_i^n w_i x_i} \\
					 &=&\frac{\langle \mathbf{W}, Y\rangle}{\langle \mathbf{W},  \mathbf{X}\rangle} 
\end{eqnarray*}

What is the optimal $\mathbf{W}$ in this case?  Let's formulate this problem in a statistical framework.

We need to make a few assumptions
As already stated, we will have the following assumptions.

- There is true model for $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{true}$ $Y=\mathbf{X}_i\boldsymbol{\beta}_{true}+\epsilon_i$
- $E(\epsilon_i)=0$, $Var(\epsilon_i)=\sigma^2$, and $Cov(\epsilon_i,\epsilon_j)=0$ for all $i,j=1,\cdots, n$
- $\mathbf{X}_i$'s are fixed by design

We will start with the estimating equation
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}&=&\frac{\langle \mathbf{W}, \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}_{true}+\epsilon \rangle}{\langle \mathbf{W},  \mathbf{X}\rangle}\\
&=&\boldsymbol{\beta}_{true}+\frac{\langle \mathbf{W}, \epsilon \rangle}{\langle \mathbf{W},  \mathbf{X}\rangle}\\
\end{eqnarray*}

The Frequentist view of statistics is relevant for this case because when we fit a model, we want to use the procedure repeatedly.  Thus, we can do hypothetical repeated sampling. For each repetition, we get $\epsilon_i$'s, from which we get $Y$, which gives us different $\hat{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}$.  
Then $E(\hat{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}})$ is the long run average under repetition.  $Var(\hat{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}})$ is long run variance under repetition.


From the assumptions, we know
\begin{eqnarray*}
E\left(\langle \mathbf{W}, \epsilon\rangle\right)&=&\sum^n_{i=1}E\left(w_i \epsilon_i\right)\\
&=&\sum^n_{i=1}w_i E(\epsilon_i)\\
&=&0
\end{eqnarray*}
and
\begin{eqnarray*}
Var\left(\langle \mathbf{W}, \epsilon\rangle \right)&=&Var\left(\sum^n_{i=1}w_i \epsilon_i \right)\\
&=&\sum^n_{i=1}Var(w_i \epsilon_i)\\
&=&\sum^n_{i=1}w_i^2Var(\epsilon_i)\\
&=&\lVert w \rVert^2\sigma^2\\
\end{eqnarray*}

Therefore 
\begin{eqnarray*}
E\left( \hat{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}} \right) &=& E\left(\boldsymbol{\beta}_{true}+ \frac{\langle \mathbf{W} \ \epsilon\rangle }{\langle \mathbf{W}\ \mathbf{X}\rangle} \right)\\
&=&\boldsymbol{\beta}_{true}\\
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{eqnarray*}
Var\left(\hat{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}\right) &=& Var\left(\boldsymbol{\beta}_{true}+ \frac{\langle \mathbf{W} \ \epsilon\rangle }{\langle \mathbf{W}\   \mathbf{X}\rangle }\right)\\
&=&Var\left(\frac{\langle \mathbf{W} \ \epsilon\rangle }{\langle \mathbf{W}\   \mathbf{X}\rangle }\right)\\
&=&\frac{\lVert \mathbf{W} \rVert^2\sigma^2}{|\langle \mathbf{W}\  \mathbf{X} \rangle |^2}\\
&=&\frac{\lVert \mathbf{W} \rVert^2\sigma^2}{(\lVert \mathbf{W}\lVert \lVert \mathbf{X} \lVert cos\theta)^2}\\
&=&\frac{\sigma^2}{\lVert \mathbf{X} \rVert^2 cos^2\theta}
\end{eqnarray*}
Thus we see in general $Var(\hat{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}})$ is minimized when $cos^2\theta=1$, which is when $\theta=0$, hence $\mathbf{W}\propto \mathbf{X}$.
Indicating that when $\mathbf{W} = c\mathbf{X}_i$ for some constant $c$, $\hat{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}$ will have minimum variance.

```

Alternatively we can start from objective function $R(\boldsymbol{\beta})=\sum^{n}_{i=1}{(y_i-\mathbf{X}_i\boldsymbol{\beta})^2}$ and try to find $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ that minimizes $R(\boldsymbol{\beta})$.
\begin{eqnarray*}
R(\boldsymbol{\beta})'&=&-2\sum^{n}_{i=1}{(y_i-x_i\boldsymbol{\beta})x_i}=0\\
&\Rightarrow&\sum^{n}_{i=1}{(x_i^2\boldsymbol{\beta})}=\sum^{n}_{i=1}{(y_ix_i)}\\
&\Rightarrow&\hat{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}=\frac{\sum^{n}_{i=1}{(y_ix_i)}}{\sum^{n}_{i=1}{(x_i^2)}}\\
\end{eqnarray*}
The resulting $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{LS}$ is the least squares estimate of $\boldsymbol{\beta}$.  Which we see is a particular case of the general estimating equation when $w_i=\mathbf{X}_i$.  Because of this result, the Least Squared Estimate is called the best unbiased linear estimator (BLUE).

#### For General $p$
We can do the same for more general $p$, for 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathbf{X}=\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
x_{11}&x_{12}&\cdots &x_{1p} \\
\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\
x_{n1}&x_{n2}&\cdots &x_{np} \\
\end{array}
\right]\verb|, |
Y=\left[
\begin{array}{c}
y_{1} \\
\vdots\\
y_{n} \\
\end{array}
\right]\verb|, |
\epsilon=\left[
\begin{array}{c}
\epsilon_{1} \\
\vdots\\
\epsilon_{n} \\
\end{array}
\right] \verb|, and |
\boldsymbol{\beta}=\left[
\begin{array}{c}
\beta_{1} \\
\vdots\\
\beta_{p} \\
\end{array}
\right]
\end{eqnarray*} 

We still have the same assumption

- There is true model for $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{true}$, $Y=\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}_{true}+\epsilon$
- $E(\epsilon)=0$, $Var(\epsilon)=\sigma^2I$
- $X$ is fixed by design

Again define objective function as $R(\boldsymbol{\beta})=\sum^{n}_{i=1}{\lVert Y-\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}\rVert^2}$, least square estimate of $\boldsymbol{\beta}$, $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{LS}$ is the one that minimizes this loss function.  We can derive $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{LS}$ via taking the derivative of $R(\boldsymbol{\beta})$ with respect to $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ and setting that equal to zero.  Hence

\begin{eqnarray*}
R(\boldsymbol{\beta})'&=&-2\mathbf{X}^{T}{(Y-\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta})}\\
&\Rightarrow&-2(\mathbf{X}^{T}Y-\mathbf{X}^{T}\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta})=0\\
&\Rightarrow&\mathbf{X}^{T}\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}=\mathbf{X}^{T}Y\\
&\Rightarrow&\hat{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}=(\mathbf{X}^{T}\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{T}Y\\
\end{eqnarray*}
So, our estimated value of $Y$ in the space spanned by $\mathbf{X}$ using the least squares estimate of the $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ can be written as
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{\hspace{0pt}Y}=\mathbf{X}\hat{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS} = \mathbf{X}(\mathbf{X}^{T}\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{T}Y\\
\end{eqnarray*}

Because $\hat{\hspace{0pt}Y}$ lives in space spanned by $X$ since $X\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is linear combination of $\mathbf{X}$, $\mathbf{X}(\mathbf{X}^{T}\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{T}$ can be thought of as projection matrix that projects $Y$ onto space spanned by $\mathbf{X}$.  This matrix is often denoted by capital letter $H$ and called the hat matrix $H=\mathbf{X}(\mathbf{X}^{T}\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{T}$.  The hat matrix is a symmetric matrix that implies $H^T=H$ and $H^2=H$.

```

Under our assumption, least square estimates have the following property.
\begin{eqnarray*}
E(\hat{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS})&=&E((\mathbf{X}^{T}\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{T}Y)\\
&=&E((\mathbf{X}^{T}\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{T}(\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}_{true}+\epsilon))\\
&=&\boldsymbol{\beta}_{true}\\
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{eqnarray*}
Var(\hat{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS})&=&Var((\mathbf{X}^{T}\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{T}Y)\\
&=&Var((\mathbf{X}^{T}\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{T}(\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}_{true}+\epsilon))\\
&=&Var((\mathbf{X}^{T}\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{T}\epsilon)\\
&=&(\mathbf{X}^{T}\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{T}Var(\epsilon)((\mathbf{X}^{T}\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{T})^T\\
&=&(\mathbf{X}^{T}\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{T}\sigma^2I((\mathbf{X}^{T}\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{T})^T\\
&=&\sigma^2(\mathbf{X}^{T}\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{T}\mathbf{X}(\mathbf{X}^{T}\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\
&=&\sigma^2(\mathbf{X}^{T}\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\
\end{eqnarray*}

Going back to the general estimating equation, 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}=(\mathbf{W}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}(\mathbf{W}^TY)&=&(\mathbf{W}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}(\mathbf{W}^T\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}_{true}+\epsilon)\\
&=&\boldsymbol{\beta}_{true}+(\mathbf{W}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{W}^T\epsilon
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{eqnarray*}
E(\hat{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}})&=&E(\boldsymbol{\beta}_{true}+(\mathbf{W}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{W}^T\epsilon)\\
&=&E(\boldsymbol{\beta}_{true})+E((\mathbf{W}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{W}^T\epsilon)\\
&=&\boldsymbol{\beta}_{true}+(\mathbf{W}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{W}^T E(\epsilon)\\
&=&\boldsymbol{\beta}_{true}\\
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{eqnarray*}
Var(\hat{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}})&=&Var(\boldsymbol{\beta}_{true}+(\mathbf{W}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{W}^T\epsilon)\\
&=&Var((\mathbf{W}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{W}^T\epsilon)\\
&=&(\mathbf{W}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{W}^T Var(\epsilon)((\mathbf{W}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{W}^T)^T\\
&=&(\mathbf{W}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{W}^T \sigma^2I((\mathbf{W}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{W}^T)^T\\
&=&\sigma^2(\mathbf{W}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{W}^T ((\mathbf{W}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{W}^T)^T\\
\end{eqnarray*}

If we denote $(\mathbf{W}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{W}^T$ as $A$ then
\begin{eqnarray*}
Var(\hat{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}})&=&\sigma^2\lVert A\rVert^2\\
\end{eqnarray*}

We will use the following consequence of Cauchy-Schwarz inequality due to the symmetry of the hat matrix
\begin{eqnarray*}
\lVert Y\rVert^2 \geq \lVert \hat{\hspace{0pt}Y}\rVert^2 \Rightarrow Y^TY \geq (HY)^T(HY)=Y^THY
\end{eqnarray*}
which is true for all $Y$.

Hence
\begin{eqnarray*}
A^TA&\geq&A^TH^THA \\
&=&(\mathbf{W}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{W}^T \mathbf{X}(\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^T (\mathbf{W}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{W}^T)^T\\
&=&(\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1}
\end{eqnarray*}

Therefore we have $Var(\hat{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}})\geq \sigma^2(\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1}=Var(\hat{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS})$, telling us once again that the least squares archive the minimum variance of the general estimator estimate, proving the BLUE property of least squares estimate.

### Model Complexity
Up to here, we assumed we knew that the true model is a linear combination of $\mathbf{X}$, but we know that is not true in general.  However, that still does not invalidate the use of least squares estimate, as Box's quote has it, ``All models are wrong, but some are useful''.  So, let us look at how our model will behave under more general assumptions.

We will assume $Y=f(\mathbf{X})+\epsilon$ where $f$ is some unknown function, and $E[\epsilon]=0$ and $Var[\epsilon]=\sigma^2I$.  Also we will assume $\mathbf{X}_1,\mathbf{X}_2,\cdots,\mathbf{X}_p$ are orthonormal.  We will not assume a linear model for $f$, but we will try to estimate $Y$ using the method of least squares. Thus $\hat{\hspace{0pt}Y}=H(f+\epsilon)=\hat{\hspace{0pt}f}+\hat{\hspace{0pt}\epsilon}$.  $\hat{\hspace{0pt}f}=\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}_{best}$ where $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{best}$ is the best we can do knowing our true model $f$ is not linear. Also $\hat{\hspace{0pt}\epsilon}=\mathbf{X}\delta$ where $\delta=[\delta_1,\delta_2,\cdots,\delta_p]^T$ and $E[\delta_i]=0$, $Var(\delta_i)=\sigma^2$ hence $E(\epsilon)=0$ and $E\left[\lVert\epsilon\rVert^2\right]=E\left[ \lVert \mathbf{X}_1\rVert^2\delta_1^2+\cdots+\lVert\mathbf{X}_p\rVert^2\delta_p^2\right]=p\sigma2^2$ which follows since $\lVert \mathbf{X}_i\rVert^2=1$ from orthonormal assumption we made earlier.

Under this setting, let's look at the training and testing errors and their behavior.
- Training Error
\begin{eqnarray*}
E\left[\lVert Y-\hat{\hspace{0pt}Y}\rVert^2\right]&=&E\left[\lVert (f+\epsilon)-(\hat{\hspace{0pt}f}+\hat{\hspace{0pt}\epsilon})\rVert^2\right]\\
&=&E\left[\lVert (f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f})+(\epsilon-\hat{\hspace{0pt}\epsilon})\rVert^2\right]\\
&=&E\left[\lVert (f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f})\rVert^2+\lVert(\epsilon-\hat{\hspace{0pt}\epsilon})\rVert^2-2\langle(f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f})\ (\epsilon-\hat{\hspace{0pt}\epsilon})\rangle\right]\\
&=&\lVert (f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f})\rVert^2+E\left[\lVert\epsilon\rVert^2-\lVert\hat{\hspace{0pt}\epsilon}\rVert^2\right]\\
&=&\lVert (f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f})\rVert^2+n\sigma^2-p\sigma^2\\
\end{eqnarray*}

```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./Images/trainingErrorDecomposed.png")
```

Which follows from the fact that $\hat{\hspace{0pt}\epsilon}$ is the projection of $\epsilon$, 
```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./Images/epsilon.png")
```

\begin{eqnarray*}
E\left[\lVert\epsilon-\hat{\hspace{0pt}\epsilon}\rVert^2\right]&=&E\left[\lVert\epsilon\rVert^2\right]+E\left[\lVert\hat{\hspace{0pt}\epsilon}\rVert^2\right]
-2E\left[\langle \epsilon\ \hat{\hspace{0pt}\epsilon}\rangle\right]\\
&=&n\sigma^2+p\sigma^2-2p\sigma^2\\
&=&n\sigma^2-p\sigma^2\\
\end{eqnarray*}
Thus we get the Pythagoras Theorem $\lVert\epsilon-\hat{\hspace{0pt}\epsilon}\rVert^2=\lVert \epsilon\rVert^2-\lVert\hat{\hspace{0pt}\epsilon}\rVert^2$.

- Testing Error
\begin{eqnarray*}
E\left[\lVert Y_{new}-\hat{\hspace{0pt}Y}\rVert^2\right]&=&E\left[\lVert (f+\epsilon_{new})-(\hat{\hspace{0pt}f}+\hat{\hspace{0pt}\epsilon})\rVert^2\right]\\
&=&E\left[\lVert (f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f})+(\epsilon_{new}-\hat{\hspace{0pt}\epsilon})\rVert^2\right]\\
&=&E\left[\lVert (f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f})\rVert^2+\lVert(\epsilon_{new}-\hat{\hspace{0pt}\epsilon})\rVert^2-2\langle(f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f})\ (\epsilon_{new}-\hat{\hspace{0pt}\epsilon})\rangle\right]\\
&=&\lVert (f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f})\rVert^2+E\left[\lVert\epsilon_{new}\rVert^2+\lVert\hat{\hspace{0pt}\epsilon}\rVert^2\right]\\
&=&\lVert (f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f})\rVert^2+n\sigma^2+p\sigma^2\\
&=&\verb|testing error| = \verb|training error| + 2p\sigma^2
\end{eqnarray*}

```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./Images/testingErrorDecomposed.png")
```


But for testing error this is different since $\hat{\hspace{0pt}\epsilon}$ is not projection of $\epsilon_{new}$:

```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./Images/epsnew.png")
```


\begin{eqnarray*}
E\left[\lVert\epsilon_{new}-\hat{\hspace{0pt}\epsilon}\rVert^2\right]&=&E\left[\lVert\epsilon_{new}\rVert^2\right]+E\left[\lVert\hat{\hspace{0pt}\epsilon}\rVert^2\right] -2E\left[\langle \epsilon_{new}\ \hat{\hspace{0pt}\epsilon}\rangle\right]\\
&=&n\sigma^2+p\sigma^2-0\\
&=&n\sigma^2+p\sigma^2\\
\end{eqnarray*}






- Estimation Error 
\begin{eqnarray*}
E\left[\lVert \hat{\hspace{0pt}Y}-f\rVert^2\right]&=&E\left[\lVert (\hat{\hspace{0pt}f}+\hat{\hspace{0pt}\epsilon})-f\rVert^2\right]\\
&=&E\left[\lVert (f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f})+\hat{\hspace{0pt}\epsilon}\rVert^2\right]\\
&=&E\left[\lVert (f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f})\rVert^2+\lVert(\hat{\hspace{0pt}\epsilon})\rVert^2-2\langle(f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f})\ \hat{\hspace{0pt}\epsilon}\rangle\right]\\
&=&\lVert (f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f})\rVert^2+p\sigma^2\\
&=&\verb|estimation error| = \verb|training error| - n\sigma^2 + 2p\sigma^2
\end{eqnarray*}

- Error of $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{best}$
\begin{eqnarray*}
E\left[\lVert Y-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f}\rVert^2\right]&=&E\left[\lVert (f+\epsilon)-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f}\rVert^2\right]\\
&=&E\left[\lVert (f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f})+\epsilon\rVert^2\right]\\
&=&E\left[\lVert (f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f})\rVert^2+\lVert(\epsilon)\rVert^2-2\langle(f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f})\ \epsilon\rangle\right]\\
&=&\lVert (f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f})\rVert^2+n\sigma^2\\
\end{eqnarray*}
Also we see that error of $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{best}$ = training error + $p\sigma^2$.


#### Training error, estimation error, error of $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{best}$and testing error

|                                     |                                                                     |

Thus, we see that

|                                     |                                                                     | 
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|when $n>2p$                           | estimation error $\leq$ training error $\leq$ error of $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{best}$ $\leq$ testing error |
|when $2p>n>p$                         | training error $\leq$ estimation error $\leq$ error of $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{best}$ $\leq$ testing error |
|when $n=p$                            | training error $\leq$ estimation error $=$ error of $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{best}$ $\leq$ testing error |
|when $n<p$                            | training error $\leq$ error of $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{best}$ $\leq$ estimation error  $\leq$ testing error |

This shows that the relative size of n to p affects the relative size of the estimation error to the other errors, but the relative size of the estimation error, error of $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{best}$, and testing error are stable.  If we increase $p$ we will have less training error because of the $-p\sigma^2$ term, which also increases the testing error by the $+p\sigma^2$ term.  

When you plot the errors against p, you will see that the training error will always go down with an increase in $p$, but the testing error will go down up to some point and then increase.  This is because when you increase $p$, not only does $-p\sigma^2$ term decrease the error for training, but also, an increase in $p$ will reduce the model bias term $\lVert (f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f})\rVert^2$.  The reduction in error by the reduction in model bias is responsible for the initial decrease in testing error.  However, at some point, the decrease in model bias gets overwhelmed by the $+p\sigma^2$ term, which is the reason testing error increases at some point.

#### Some thoughts on extreme cases
In extreme cases where $Y$ is pure noise, that is $f=0$.  Then $n=p$ and $\epsilon=\hat{\hspace{0pt}\epsilon}$.  Therefore, your training error will be 0, but when you test your model, then $\epsilon_{new}+\hat{\hspace{0pt}\epsilon}=\epsilon_{new}+\epsilon$ which is more error in general. 
Generally speaking, you don't want to be too clever and interpret too many patterns in your error, or else you will be penalized in your test.



#### Decomposition of estimation error
For general estimator $\tilde{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}$, let $\hat{\hspace{0pt}f}=\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}_{best}$, and let $\mu=E[\tilde{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}]$.  Then estimation error can be decomposed into model bias, estimation bias, and estimation variance.

\begin{eqnarray*}
E\lVert f-\mathbf{X}\tilde{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}\rVert^2&=&E\lVert f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f}+\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}_{best}-\mathbf{X}\tilde{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}\rVert^2\\
&=&\lVert f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f}\rVert^2+E\lVert \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}_{best}-\mathbf{X}\tilde{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}\rVert^2\\
&=&\lVert f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f}\rVert^2+\lVert \boldsymbol{\beta}_{best}-\mu \rVert^2 +E\lVert \mu - \tilde{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}\rVert^2 \\
\end{eqnarray*}

If the $\tilde{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}=\hat{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}$, that is $E[\hat{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{LS}]=\boldsymbol{\beta}_{best}$, then $\lVert \boldsymbol{\beta}_{best}-\mu \rVert^2=0$.


Model bias and estimation bias can be very ambiguous.  Suppose there are 20000 predictors, $p=20000$ and $n$, that are not quite as large as $p$.
To fit a model in such a situation, there are two ways to go about it, both of which will be discussed later under the topic of regularization.  One is to do model selection, where you leave the most significant predictors in the model and exclude the rest.  Another is to do a shrinkage estimation where you shrink most of the estimates down to zero.  Essentially, you are doing the same thing; however, model selection will increase the model bias, whereas the shrinkage method will increase the estimation bias.


### Property of General Estimator Error
(1) For a general estimator of regression coefficients, investigate the relationship between the testing (generalization, prediction) error and training error and identify the effective degrees of freedom.

For general estimator $\tilde{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}=[\tilde{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}_1,\cdots,\tilde{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}_p]^T$, let $\hat{\hspace{0pt}f}=X\tilde{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}$, and let $\mu=E[\tilde{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}]=[\mu_{\tilde{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}_1}},\cdots,\mu_{\tilde{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}_p}}]^T$. Then, estimation error, training error, and testing error can be written as:

- Estimation Error 
\begin{eqnarray*}
E\left[\lVert f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f}\rVert^2\right] &=& E\left[\lVert f-X\tilde{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}\rVert^2\right]
\end{eqnarray*}

- Training Error
\begin{eqnarray*}
E\left[\lVert Y-X\tilde{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}\rVert^2\right]&=&E\left[\lVert f+\epsilon-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f}\rVert^2\right]\\
&=&E\left[\rVert f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f}+\epsilon\rVert^2\right]\\
&=&E\left[\rVert f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f}\rVert^2+\rVert \epsilon\rVert^2+2\langle f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f},\ \epsilon \rangle\right]\\
&=&E\left[\rVert f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f}\rVert^2\right]+E\left[\rVert \epsilon\rVert^2\right]+2E\left[\langle f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f},\ \epsilon \rangle\right]\\
&=&E\left[\rVert f-X\tilde{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}\rVert^2\right]+n\sigma^2-2E\langle \hat{\hspace{0pt}f},\ \epsilon \rangle\\
&=&\verb|estimation error|+n\sigma^2-2E\langle \hat{\hspace{0pt}f},\ \epsilon \rangle\\
\end{eqnarray*}

- Testing Error 
\begin{eqnarray*}
E\left[\rVert Y_{new}-X\tilde{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}\rVert^2\right]&=&E\left[\rVert f+\epsilon_{new}-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f}\rVert^2\right]\\
&=&E\left[\rVert f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f}+\epsilon_{new}\rVert^2\right]\\
&=&E\left[\rVert f-\hat{\hspace{0pt}f}\rVert^2+\rVert \epsilon_{new}\rVert^2\right]\\
&=&E\left[\rVert f-X\tilde{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}\rVert^2\right]+n\sigma^2\\
&=&\verb|estimation error|+n\sigma^2\\
&=&\verb|training error|+2E\langle \hat{\hspace{0pt}f},\ \epsilon \rangle\\
\end{eqnarray*}

#### Over-fitting

Let's look closely at the following relationships.   

- $$\mbox{training error} =\mbox{estimation error}+n\sigma^2-2E\langle \hat{\hspace{0pt}f},\ \epsilon \rangle$$
- $$\mbox{testing error} = \mbox{training error}+2E\langle \hat{\hspace{0pt}f},\ \epsilon \rangle$$

You can see that the training error is decreased by $2E\langle \hat{\hspace{0pt}f},\ \epsilon \rangle$ term, but the testing error is increased by the same $2E\langle \hat{\hspace{0pt}f},\ \epsilon \rangle$ term.  Generally speaking, $E\langle \hat{\hspace{0pt}f},\ \epsilon \rangle$ term is like a correlation between your estimated signal $\hat{\hspace{0pt}f}$ and noise $\epsilon$.  So it can be interpreted as how much noise your estimator $\tilde{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}$ absorbs.  Thus, when you fit a model, you want to control this in order to avoid over-fitting.

#### The effective degrees of freedom

For Least Squares Estimate testing error =training error$+2p\sigma^2$.If we let $2p\sigma^2=2E\langle \hat{\hspace{0pt}f},\ \epsilon \rangle$ we get $p=\frac{E\langle \hat{\hspace{0pt}f},\ \epsilon \rangle}{\sigma^2}$ hence we see that effective degrees of freedom in $\tilde{\hspace{0pt}\boldsymbol{\beta}}$ is $\frac{E\langle \hat{\hspace{0pt}f},\ \epsilon \rangle}{\sigma^2}$.
